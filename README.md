!["Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.](/media/cheshire_cat.png)

[^1]: I would be remiss if I didn't include the original text behind this quotable but inaccurate aphorism from *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice-VI.html)*.
    >   The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. "Cheshire Puss," she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. "Come, it's pleased so far," thought Alice, and she went on. "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" \
  "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat. \
  "I don't much care where--" said Alice. \
  "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat. \
  "--so long as I get somewhere," Alice added as an explanation. \
  "Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough."
